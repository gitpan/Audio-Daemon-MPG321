Audio-Daemon-MPG321 version 0.001
=================================

Audio::Daemon::MPG321 is a frontend to Audio::Play::MPG321 and its main
objective is to provide the framework for building a song queue. You'll need
Audio::Play::MPG321 and all of its dependencies satisfied, of course.

I will be releasing a frontend to this module that is designed to be a
full-blown music player for the end-user. It will be able to construct and
dynamically manage multiple song queues at once. It's quite useful. Please keep
an eye out for it.

Please read the POD documentation contained within the module. Pay close
attention to the synopsis and the loop that you must run. Also, send fixes,
comments, and suggestions to <dabreegster@cpan.org>. Have fun!

INSTALLATION

To install this module, type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL

(But you really shouldn't have to if you had any sense and were using an
automated CPAN tool for installation.)

DEPENDENCIES

  Audio::Daemon::MPG321 needs Audio::Play::MPG321. Go ahead and use version
